The   $scope.$digest()   function   iterates   through   all   the   watches   in   the   $scope   object,
and   its   child   $scope   objects   (if it has any).
When   $digest()   iterates   over   the   watches,   it   calls   the   value   function   for   each   watch.
If   the   value   returned   by   the   value   function   is   different   than   the   value   it   returned
the   last   time   it   was   called,   the   listener   function   for   that   watch   is   called.

The   $digest()   function   is   called   whenever   AngularJS   thinks   it   is   necessary.   For   instance,
after   a   button  click   handler   has   been   executed,   or   after   an   AJAX   call   returns   (after   the   done() /
fail()   callback   function   has   been   executed).

You   may   encounter   some   corner   cases   where   AngularJS   does   not   call   the   $digest()   function   for   you.
You   will  usually  detect   that   by   noticing   that   the   data   bindings   do   not   upate   the   displayed   values.
In   that   case,   call   $scope.$digest()   and   it   should   work.   Or,   you   can   perhaps   use   $scope.$apply()   instead
