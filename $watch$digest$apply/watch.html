The AngularJS $scope functions $watch(), $digest() and $apply() are some of the central functions in AngularJS.

when   you    do   changes   in   a   variable    on   the   $scope   object    within   your    view,   the   $scope   object
auto-magically   updates   itself.
Similarly,   whenever   the   $scope   object   changes,   the   view   updates   itself   with   the   new   value.
AngularJS   handle   data-binding   mechanism   with   the   help   of   three   powerful   functions:
 $watch(),   $digest()    and   $apply().-->

<!--When you create a data binding from somewhere in your view to a variable on the $scope object,
AngularJS creates a "watch" internally.
A watch means that AngularJS watches changes in the variable on the $scope object.
The framework is "watching" the variable. Watches are created using the $scope.$watch() function-->
